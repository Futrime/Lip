# FAQ

## Where can I find online available teeth?

Visit [lipWeb](https://www.lippkg.com).

## It downloads so slowly! What can I do?

lip downloads teeth via GOPROXY. You can use a faster proxy by running `lip config GoModuleProxyURL <url>`. lip supports GitHub mirror as well. You can use it by running `lip config GitHubMirrorURL <url>`. If you are setting up HTTP proxy, you can simply set the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable.

## It always shows errors when I try to install a tooth!

Probably the cache is corrupted. Try to purge the cache by running `lip cache purge`.

## How can I update lip?

Remove the current lip executable and install the latest version.
