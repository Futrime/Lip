# Quickstart

To get started with using Lip, you should [have Lip installed](installation.md) first. If you are not familiar with the command-line interface, you can also use [LipUI](lipui_quickstart.md) to manage your tooths.

## Ensure you have a working Lip

As a first step, you should check that you have a working Lip installed. This can be done by running the following commands and making sure that the output looks similar.

```shell
> lip --version
Lip 0.11.0 from C:\Users\ExampleUser\AppData\Local\Lip\lip.exe
```
