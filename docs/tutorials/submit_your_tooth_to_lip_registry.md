# Tutorial: Submit Your Tooth to Lip Registry

Since v0.8.0, Lip supports looking up tooths from a registry and installing them. You can submit your tooth to the registry to make it easier for others to install your tooth.

In this tutorial, we will submit a tooth to the official Lip registry (<https://registry.litebds.com>).

## Create a Lip Tooth

Follow the [Create a Lip Tooth](create_a_lip_tooth.md) tutorial to create a Lip tooth. Make sure that you have a `tooth.json` file in the root directory of your tooth. And the **tooth** field is right the repository path of your tooth.

## Submit Your Tooth to Lip Registry

To submit your tooth to the registry, you need to create a pull request to the registry repository (<https://github.com/LiteLDev/Registry>).

You should create a new file in the `tooths` directory. The file name should be the alias of your tooth. The file content should be a simplified version of your `tooth.json`. The file content should be in JSON format and should contain the following fields. In this example, the alias of the tooth is `lip`. Therefore, the file name is `lip.json`.

```json
{
    "format_version": 1,
    "tooth": "github.com/Tooth-Hub/Lip",
    "information": {
        "author": "LiteLDev",
        "description": "A package installer not only for LiteLoaderBDS",
        "homepage": "https://www.example.com",
        "license": "MIT",
        "name": "Lip",
        "repository": "github.com/LipPkg/Lip",
        "tags": ["utility", "package-manager"]
    }
}
```

The `format_version`, `tooth`, `author`, `description` and `name` fields are required. The fields should also follow these rules:

- The `format_version` field should be `1`.
- The `tooth` field should be the tooth repository path without protocol prefix. Currently, we only accept tooths that are hosted on GitHub.
- The `author` field should be the GitHub username of the author of the tooth.
- The `description` field should be a one-line description of the tooth.
- The `homepage` field should be a valid URL with `http://` or `https://` prefix.
- The `license` field should be a valid [SPDX license identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/) (including deprecated ones). For private tooth, just left it blank.
- The `repository` filed should be the project source code repository path without protocol prefix. Currently, we only accept repositories that are hosted on GitHub.
- The `tags` field should be an array of strings. Each string should be a valid tag. The tag can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens [a-z0-9-]. The tag should not start or end with a hyphen. The tag should not contain consecutive hyphens.

You may want to display a README page on the registry website. You can create a Markdown file with the same name as the registry file in `readmes` directory. For example, you can create a `lip.md` file. The content of the file will be displayed on the registry website.

After you create the file, you can create a pull request to the registry repository. The registry maintainers will review your pull request and merge it if it is valid.

### How to Set Tags

You can set tags for your tooth. The tags will be displayed on the registry website. You can set tags in the `tags` field of the registry file. The `tags` field should be an array of strings. Each string should be a valid tag. The tag can only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens [a-z0-9-]. The tag should not start or end with a hyphen.
